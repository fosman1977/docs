### Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Diary clash | Already committed during the required period |
| Conflict of interest | Have acted for opposing party |
| Outside expertise | Matter not in your practice areas |
| Capacity | Workload too high currently |
| Fee level | Fee not appropriate for the work |

## Impact on Engagement Score

Your lead acceptance rate affects your engagement score. While you should never accept work you cannot do, frequent rejections may prompt a discussion with clerks about your availability or practice development.

<Tip>
If rejecting, provide clear reasons - this helps clerks make better assignments in future.
