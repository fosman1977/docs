How your calendar syncs with the Chambers Platform.
</Note>

## Calendar Overview

The platform integrates with Microsoft 365 to sync your calendar data. This enables:

- Automatic availability detection for lead assignment
- Utilisation tracking based on calendar events
- Visibility of your schedule for clerks
- Court date and meeting tracking

## What Gets Synced

The platform reads your calendar to understand:

- Court appearances and hearing dates
- Client meetings
- Conference calls
- Leave and holidays
- Other commitments affecting availability

## Privacy

Your calendar data is used to calculate utilisation and availability. Detailed event information is not exposed to other users - only your overall availability status.

## Managing Availability

If the automatic sync doesn't reflect your true availability:

1. Update your calendar with accurate events
2. Mark leave periods clearly
3. Use all-day events for full-day commitments
4. Contact clerks if availability shows incorrectly

## Calendar View in Platform

Access a read-only view of your synced calendar from the Calendar section. Use Outlook/Microsoft 365 to make changes to your actual calendar.

<Tip>
Keeping your calendar up to date helps clerks make appropriate lead assignments.
