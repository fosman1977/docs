## What are Contribution Tiers?

Barristers contribute a percentage of their gross fees to chambers operating costs. The percentage decreases as earnings increase, following a tiered structure.

## Tier Structure

The current contribution tiers are:

| Tier | Income Range | Rate |
|------|--------------|------|
| Tier 1 | Up to £500,000 | 14% |
| Tier 2 | £500,001 - £750,000 | 7% |
| Tier 3 | £750,001 - £1,000,000 | 3% |
| Tier 4 | Over £1,000,000 | 1% |

## Example Calculation

For a barrister earning £600,000:

```
First £500,000 × 14% = £70,000
Remaining £100,000 × 7% = £7,000
─────────────────────────────────
Total contribution = £77,000
```
