What leads are and how they work in the Chambers Platform.
</Note>

## What is a Lead?

A lead represents a potential new instruction from a client. Leads are created by clerks when enquiries come in from solicitors, corporations, or other clients.

## Lead Information

Each lead contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | Brief description of the matter |
| Description | Detailed information about the work |
| Client | The instructing party |
| Practice Area | E.g., Criminal Fraud, Civil Litigation |
| Jurisdiction | Where the matter is based |
| Estimated Value | Expected fee value |
| Source | How the enquiry came in |

## Lead Lifecycle

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pending Response">
    Awaiting barrister acceptance/rejection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accepted">
    Barrister has agreed to take the work

## Multi-Barrister Assignment

Leads may be assigned to multiple barristers simultaneously. If more than one barrister accepts, the clerk will select the most appropriate.
