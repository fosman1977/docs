Opportunities are business development activities organised by chambers that can lead to new client relationships and instructions. Unlike leads (which are immediate client enquiries), opportunities represent potential future work from networking, publishing, or speaking engagements.

    A[Clerk Creates Opportunity] --> B[Barristers Invited]
    B --> C[You Accept/Decline]
    C --> D[Attend/Complete]
    D --> E[Leads Generated]
    E --> F[Track ROI]
```

1. **Clerk creates** an opportunity with date, venue, and target audience
2. **You receive** an invitation in your dashboard
3. **You accept** to confirm participation (or decline with a note)
4. **After the event**, any enquiries are logged as leads linked to the opportunity
5. **Management tracks** which opportunities generate the best ROI

## Why Participate?

| Benefit | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Build your profile** | Articles and speaking establish you as a subject matter expert |
| **Develop client relationships** | Events create face-to-face connections with instructing solicitors |
| **Generate leads** | Opportunities often result in direct enquiries tracked back to your participation |
| **Improve engagement score** | Active participation increases your quarterly engagement rating |
| **Support chambers** | Collective BD efforts benefit everyone's practices |

## Opportunity to Lead Connection

When an opportunity generates an enquiry, the resulting lead shows its source with a **"From: [Opportunity Title]"** badge. This linking allows chambers to measure:
- Which opportunity types generate the most leads
- Individual barrister ROI from BD activities
- Overall conversion rates from events to instructions

## Your Participation History

View all opportunities you've participated in from your profile:

- **Accepted** - Confirmed participation
- **Completed** - Activity finished
- **Leads Generated** - Enquiries attributed to your participation
- **Instructed** - Leads that converted to actual work

<Tip>
Your opportunity participation contributes to your [engagement score](/barrister/engagement-score). Active barristers typically score higher.
