## What are Opportunities?

Opportunities are business development activities that can lead to new client relationships and instructions. They differ from leads in that they represent potential future work rather than immediate enquiries.

## Why Participate?

- Build your professional profile and reputation
- Develop new client relationships
- Generate leads for future instructions

## Opportunity to Lead Connection

Opportunities can generate leads. When you participate in an opportunity that results in an enquiry, that lead is linked to the opportunity - helping track the ROI of business development activities.
