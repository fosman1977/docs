Understanding your utilisation and availability metrics.
</Note>

## Why Utilisation Matters

Utilisation data helps:

- Identify when you have capacity for new work
- Spot quiet periods early
- Balance workload appropriately
- Make informed decisions about availability

## Viewing Utilisation

Access utilisation data from:

- **Dashboard** - Overview widget
- **Utilisation page** - Detailed view
- **Your profile** - Individual data

## Understanding the Data

### Utilisation Percentage

| Percentage | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 80%+ | Very busy, limited capacity |
| 60-80% | Optimal utilisation |
| 40-60% | Has capacity for more work |
| Below 40% | Quiet period |

### How It's Calculated

Utilisation is calculated from your calendar data synced from Microsoft 365. Court dates, meetings, and other commitments all contribute to your utilisation figure.

## Keeping Data Accurate

To ensure accurate utilisation:

- Keep your calendar up to date
- Mark leave periods clearly
- Use all-day events for full-day commitments
- Contact clerks if something shows incorrectly

<Tip>
Utilisation is calculated from calendar data - keeping your calendar updated helps clerks make appropriate lead assignments.
