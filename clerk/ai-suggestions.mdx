<Note>
AI Suggestions help clerks quickly identify the best barristers for each lead.
</Note>

## What Are AI Suggestions?

When you create or review a lead, AI can suggest which barristers are best suited based on:

- **Practice Areas** - Matched via the practice areas junction table for accurate expertise mapping
- **Specialisations** - Legacy specialisation text matching
- **Seniority Preference** - KC/Silk, Senior Junior, or Junior filtering
- **Jurisdiction** - Primary and additional jurisdiction matching
- **Experience** - Years of call matched to case complexity
- **Availability** - Current utilisation levels
- **Languages** - Multilingual capability for international matters

## How Matching Works

The AI suggestion engine uses a comprehensive scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors:

### Practice Area Matching (up to 25 points)

The system matches barristers to leads using a multi-tier approach:

1. **Exact ID Match** - If the lead's practice area ID matches a barrister's assigned practice area
   - Primary practice area: +25 points
   - Secondary practice area: +20 points

2. **Category Match** - Matches broader categories (e.g., "Criminal Fraud" matches "Criminal Law")
   - Considers practice area names and categories
   - Common legal term matching (fraud, criminal, civil, commercial, regulatory)

3. **Legacy Text Match** - Falls back to specialisation text matching if no practice areas assigned

### Jurisdiction Matching (up to 20 points)

- **Primary Jurisdiction Match**: +15 points
- **Additional Jurisdictions**: +5 points each (up to 5 additional points)

### Seniority Filtering

When you set a seniority preference, barristers are **pre-filtered** before scoring:

| Preference | Filter Applied |
|------------|----------------|
| **KC/Silk** | Only `is_silk = true` barristers |
| **Senior Junior** | 10+ years call AND `is_silk = false` |
| **Junior** | Under 10 years call AND `is_silk = false` |
| **Any** | No filter - all eligible barristers |

Barristers matching the preference receive a +10 point bonus.

### Experience Level Matching (up to 10 points)

Experience is matched to case complexity:

| Complexity | Required Experience | Points |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Expert | 15+ years | +10 |
| High | 10+ years | +8 |
| Medium | 5+ years | +6 |
| Standard | 3+ years | +4 |

### Additional Factors

- **KC/Silk for Complex Cases**: +10 points for high-value or complex matters
- **Multilingual**: +5 points for international cases with multiple jurisdictions

## Getting Suggestions

### From the Lead Page

1. Open a lead (new or existing)
2. Look for the **AI Suggestions** panel
3. Click **Get Suggestions** button
4. Review the ranked list

### Understanding the Results

Each suggestion shows:

- **Match Score** (e.g., 92%) - Overall match percentage
- **Reasons** - Specific factors driving the recommendation
- **Availability** - Current utilisation percentage
- **Action buttons** - Assign or view profile

### Match Score Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Excellent match - highly recommended |
| 75-89% | Good match - strong candidate |
| 60-74% | Moderate match - consider if others unavailable |
| Below 60% | Weak match - typically not shown |

### Sample Reasoning

The AI provides specific reasoning for each suggestion:

> "Sarah Thompson KC - Specialises in Criminal Fraud, Practices in England & Wales, KC/Silk as requested"

> "James Wilson - Senior Junior (12 years call), Specialises in Civil Fraud, Good availability (45%)"

## Improving Suggestion Quality

Better input = better suggestions:

| Field | Impact | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Practice Area | **Critical** | Primary matching factor via practice areas table |
| Seniority Preference | **High** | Pre-filters barrister pool before scoring |
| Jurisdiction | **High** | Matches primary and additional jurisdictions |
| Complexity Level | **Medium** | Matches experience requirements |
| Value Estimate | **Medium** | Influences seniority appropriateness |
| Description | **Medium** | May identify specific needs |

<Tip>
Setting the seniority preference is the most effective way to quickly narrow suggestions to appropriate candidates.

## When to Override AI

### Specific Client Requests
- Client has asked for particular barrister
- Prior relationship exists

### Strategic Assignments
- Development opportunity for junior
- Mentorship pairing needed

### Your Expert Judgement
- You know context AI doesn't
- Interpersonal factors matter

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="check">
    - Fill in lead details first
    - Set seniority preference if known
    - Review reasons, not just scores
    - Use your judgement alongside AI
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't" icon="xmark">
    - Request suggestions for empty leads
    - Blindly assign highest score
    - Ignore client preferences
    - Skip reviewing the reasons
  </Card>

- Barrister specialisations

### What AI Never Sees
- Client names (tokenised)
- Contact details
- Exact financial figures
- Personal identifiable information
