<Note>
AI Suggestions help clerks quickly identify the best barristers for each lead.
</Note>

## What Are AI Suggestions?

When you create or review a lead, AI can suggest which barristers are best suited based on:

- **Specialisations** - Practice area expertise
- **Experience** - Years of call, track record
- **Seniority Preference** - KC/Silk, Senior Junior, or Junior filtering
- **Availability** - Current utilisation levels
- **Jurisdiction** - Geographic expertise
- **Past Performance** - Success rates, client feedback

## Getting Suggestions

### From the Lead Page

1. Open a lead (new or existing)
2. Look for the **AI Suggestions** panel
3. Click **Get Suggestions** button
4. Review the ranked list

### Understanding the Results

Each suggestion shows:

- **Match Score** (e.g., 92%) - How well they match
- **Reasons** - Why they're recommended
- **Availability** - Current utilisation
- **Action buttons** - Assign or view profile

### Match Score Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Excellent match - highly recommended |
| 75-89% | Good match - strong candidate |
| 60-74% | Moderate match - consider if others unavailable |
| Below 60% | Weak match - typically not shown |

## Improving Suggestion Quality

Better input = better suggestions. Include:

| Field | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Practice Area | **Critical** - Primary matching factor |
| Seniority Preference | **High** - Filters by experience level |
| Jurisdiction | **High** - Filters by expertise |
| Value Estimate | **Medium** - Matches seniority level |
| Description | **Medium** - Identifies specific needs |

## When to Override AI

### Specific Client Requests
- Client has asked for particular barrister
- Prior relationship exists

### Strategic Assignments
- Development opportunity for junior
- Mentorship pairing needed

### Your Expert Judgement
- You know context AI doesn't
- Interpersonal factors matter

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Don't" icon="xmark">
    - Request suggestions for empty leads
    - Blindly assign highest score
    - Ignore client preferences
    - Skip reviewing the reasons
