## Real-Time Time Entries

One of the platform's most powerful features is automatic time entry sync. When barristers log their billable time, you receive it instantly.

### How It Works

1. **Barrister logs time** - They record hours worked on a matter
2. **Instant notification** - You receive a real-time alert
3. **Review & approve** - Check the entry details and approve
4. **Process invoice** - Include approved entries on client invoices

<Info>
Time entries appear on your dashboard within seconds of submission, eliminating the traditional delays in billing workflows.
