## What Is Mapping?

Client-barrister mapping shows:
- Which barristers have worked with which clients
- Frequency of instructions
- Preferred relationships

## Why It Matters

Understanding mappings helps:
- Assign leads to barristers with existing relationships
- Identify clients who prefer specific barristers
- Spot opportunities to introduce new barristers

## Viewing Mappings

### From Client Profile
See all barristers who have worked with this client.

### From Barrister Profile
See all clients a barrister has worked with.

### Mapping Reports
Generate reports showing client-barrister relationships across chambers.

## Using Mappings

When assigning leads:
- Check if client has preferred barristers
- Note any existing relationships
- Consider introducing new relationships strategically
