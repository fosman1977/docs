Step-by-step guide to creating leads in the system.
</Note>

## Before Creating a Lead

Gather the following information:

- Client/instructing party details
- Matter description
- Practice area and jurisdiction
- Estimated value and timeframe
- Preferred barrister seniority level
- Source opportunity (if from an event or BD activity)
- Any special requirements or conflicts

## Creating the Lead

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Leads">
    Click "Leads" in the sidebar, then click "New Lead" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Basic Details">
    - **Title** - Clear, descriptive title for the matter
    - **Description** - Detailed description of the work
    - **Source** - How the enquiry came in (email, referral, etc.)
    - **Client** - Select existing client or create new
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classification">
    - **Practice Area** - Select the relevant area(s)
    - **Jurisdiction** - Where the matter is based
    - **Urgency** - Normal, Urgent, or Critical
    - **Seniority Preference** - Preferred barrister experience level (see below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Source Opportunity (Optional)">
    If this lead originated from a business development opportunity or event, link it here:
    - **Source Opportunity** - Select the opportunity/event that generated this lead

    This creates an audit trail connecting BD activities to actual instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Financial Details">
    - **Estimated Value** - Expected fee value
    - **Fee Type** - Fixed, hourly, or TBC
    - **Notes** - Any fee-related notes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Create Lead" to save. The lead will be created with "Created" status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Seniority Preference

The seniority preference field helps filter AI suggestions to match client requirements or case complexity:

| Option | Description | Typical Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Any** | All eligible barristers considered | Default - let AI determine best match |
| **KC/Silk** | Only King's Counsel | High-value, complex matters requiring senior advocacy |
| **Senior Junior** | 10+ years call (not Silk) | Substantial matters needing significant experience |
| **Junior** | Under 10 years call | Routine matters, cost-sensitive clients, development opportunities |

<Tip>
Setting seniority preference filters both AI suggestions and the manual barrister selection list, making it faster to find appropriate candidates.
</Tip>

### How Seniority Affects Matching

When you set a seniority preference:

1. **AI Suggestions** - Only barristers matching the criteria are considered
2. **Manual Selection** - The barrister list is pre-filtered
3. **Match Scoring** - Barristers receive bonus points for matching the requested seniority

## Source Opportunity Tracking

Linking leads to their source opportunity provides valuable business intelligence:

### Benefits

- **Attribution** - Track which BD activities generate instructions
- **ROI Analysis** - Measure return on event attendance and marketing
- **Pipeline Visibility** - See the journey from opportunity to converted work
- **Reporting** - Generate reports on lead sources and conversion rates

### How It Appears

When a lead is linked to a source opportunity:

- A **"From: [Opportunity Title]"** badge displays on the lead card
- The opportunity appears in the lead's detail page
- Reports can filter by source opportunity

<Info>
You can link a lead to a source opportunity at creation or edit it later from the lead details page.
</Info>

## After Creation

The system will:

- Generate AI barrister suggestions (filtered by seniority preference)
- Show the lead in your pending items
- Display the source opportunity link if set
- Allow you to proceed with assignment

<Tip>
The more detail you provide, the better the AI suggestions will be. Practice area, jurisdiction, and seniority preference are the most important factors for accurate matching.
</Tip>
