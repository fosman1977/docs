This guide walks you through creating a new lead from a client enquiry. For bulk imports, see [CSV Import](/clerk/csv-import).

## Before You Start

Gather the following information from the client enquiry:

| Required | Optional |
|----------|----------|
| Client/instructing party name | Estimated fee value |
| Matter title and description | Fee type (fixed/hourly) |
| Practice area | Urgency level |
| Jurisdiction | Preferred barrister seniority |
| | Source opportunity (if from BD activity) |

## The Lead Creation Form

When you click **New Lead**, you'll see:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the lead form">
    Click **Leads** in the sidebar → **New Lead** button (top right).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a clear title">
    Use format: **[Type] - [Client/Party Name]**

    **Good:** "Commercial Dispute - ABC Corporation"
    **Avoid:** "New matter" (too vague)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write a detailed description">
    Include: nature of work, key parties, relevant dates, deadlines, and any conflicts to check. More detail = better AI suggestions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the source">
    How did the enquiry reach chambers? (Email, Phone, Referral, Direct, Website, Event)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or create client">
    Search existing clients or click **Create New Client** if not found.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose practice area and classification">
    - **Practice Area** - The AI uses this for barrister matching
    - **Jurisdiction** - Where the matter is based
    - **Urgency** - Normal (48hrs), Urgent (24hrs), or Critical (same-day)
    - **Seniority Preference** - Filter suggestions by experience level (see below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link source opportunity (optional)">
    If this lead originated from a BD activity or event, select it from the dropdown. This tracks ROI on business development.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add financial details (optional)">
    Estimated value and fee type help with prioritisation and barrister matching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the lead">
    Click **Create Lead**. Status will be "Created".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Seniority Preference

The seniority preference field filters AI suggestions to match client requirements:

| Option | Description | Typical Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Any** | All eligible barristers considered | Default - let AI determine best match |
| **KC/Silk** | Only King's Counsel | High-value, complex matters |
| **Senior Junior** | 10+ years call (not Silk) | Substantial matters needing experience |
| **Junior** | Under 10 years call | Routine matters, cost-sensitive clients |

<Tip>
Setting seniority preference filters both AI suggestions and the manual barrister selection list.
</Tip>

## Source Opportunity Tracking

Linking leads to their source opportunity provides valuable business intelligence:

- **Attribution** - Track which BD activities generate instructions
- **ROI Analysis** - Measure return on event attendance
- **Pipeline Visibility** - See the journey from opportunity to converted work

When a lead is linked to a source opportunity, a **"From: [Opportunity Title]"** badge displays on the lead card.

## What Happens Next

After creation:

1. **Deduplication check** - System looks for similar existing leads
2. **AI suggestions generated** - Recommends suitable barristers (filtered by seniority)
3. **Added to dashboard** - Appears in your "Action Required" widget

Proceed to [assign barristers](/clerk/assigning-leads) to the lead.

<Tip>
Leads with detailed descriptions receive more accurate AI suggestions. Practice area, jurisdiction, and seniority preference are the most important factors for matching.
