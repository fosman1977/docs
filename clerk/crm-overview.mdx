- Manual mapping is created

### Mapping Strength

The system tracks relationship strength based on:
- Number of instructions
- Recent activity
- Success rate
- Revenue generated

## Data Quality

1. Navigate to **CRM** → **Duplicates**
2. Review suggested matches
3. Merge or dismiss duplicates

### Data Enrichment

Client records are enriched with:
- Industry classifications
- Company size data
- Contact verification status

## CSV Import

  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload File">
    Go to CRM → Import → Upload CSV
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Fields">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">

  </Step>

  </Step>

## GDPR Compliance

Client records include consent tracking:

- Marketing consent status
- Data processing consent
- Last consent update date
- Consent source

See [GDPR & Privacy](/management/gdpr-privacy) for more details.

## Client-Matter Linking

Clients can be linked to multiple cases, allowing you to track which clients are associated with which matters.

### Key Features

- **Multiple clients per case**: Link as many clients as needed to a single case
- **Primary designation**: Mark one client as the primary client for each case
- **Associated Matters view**: See all linked cases on the client detail page
- **Automatic filtering**: Billing history excludes cases already shown in Associated Matters

### How It Works

1. **From Client Detail Page**: View all associated matters in the Matters tab
2. **From Case Records**: Use the Linked Clients panel to add/remove clients

<Tip>
When a case already appears in a client's Associated Matters, it won't be duplicated in the Billing Case History section.
</Tip>

See [Case Records](/clerk/case-records) for details on linking clients to cases.
