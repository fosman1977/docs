## Follow-up Information

Each follow-up shows:

- **Title** - What needs to be done

- **Related to** - Lead, client, or opportunity
- **Assigned to** - Who is responsible
- **Priority** - High, medium, or low
- **Notes** - Additional context

## Actions

- Indicate if the contact responded
- Add notes about what happened
- Automatically schedule a follow-up task
