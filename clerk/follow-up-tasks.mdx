How to work with and manage follow-up tasks efficiently, including recording detailed outcomes with the Task Completion Modal.
</Note>

## Daily Workflow

Start each day by:
1. Checking today's follow-ups
2. Addressing any overdue items
3. Reviewing upcoming tasks

## Task Management

### Prioritising
- High priority - Action today
- Medium priority - Action this week
- Low priority - Action when possible

### Bulk Actions
Select multiple follow-ups to:
- Mark as complete
- Reschedule together
- Reassign

## Completing Tasks with the Task Completion Modal

When you complete a follow-up task, especially opportunity-related tasks, you'll use the **Task Completion Modal** to record detailed outcomes. This helps track the success of your business development activities.

### Opening the Modal

1. Navigate to your follow-up task
2. Click the **Complete** button
3. The Task Completion Modal will open

### Recording the Outcome

Select one of six outcome options to describe what happened:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Successful" icon="circle-check">
    Task completed with a positive outcome. The contact engaged and the goal was achieved.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Response" icon="clock">
    You attempted to reach the contact but received no reply. Consider scheduling a follow-up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declined" icon="circle-xmark">
    The contact is not interested. Record this to avoid future contact on this matter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Partial" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Some progress was made but the task isn't fully complete. Document what was achieved.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rescheduled" icon="rotate">
    The contact asked to be contacted at a later date. Schedule the follow-up accordingly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Failed" icon="ban">
    Could not complete the task (e.g., email bounced, wrong contact details, etc.).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Options

After selecting an outcome, you can:

- **Contact Responded** - Toggle this on if the contact replied to your outreach
- **Notes** - Add detailed notes about what happened, any important information, or context for future reference

### Scheduling Follow-up Tasks

The modal allows you to automatically create a follow-up task based on the outcome:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Follow-up">
    Toggle **Schedule follow-up task** on. This is auto-enabled for "No Response" or "Rescheduled" outcomes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Type">
    Choose the follow-up type:
    - Send follow-up email
    - Schedule meeting/call
    - LinkedIn connection
    - Add to CRM
    - Create lead
    - Custom task
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Description">
    Enter a description of what needs to be done in the follow-up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Due Date">
    Choose when the follow-up should be completed. Defaults to 3 days from now.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    Click **Complete Task** to save the outcome and create the follow-up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The system automatically suggests scheduling a follow-up when the outcome is "No Response" or "Rescheduled" to ensure no opportunities are lost.
</Tip>

## Automation

The system automatically creates follow-ups for:
- Leads pending response over 24 hours
- Overdue barrister responses
- Upcoming opportunity deadlines

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Address overdue items first">
    Overdue tasks should be your first priority each morning. These represent potential missed opportunities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic due dates">
    Consider your workload and the urgency of the task when setting due dates. Over-promising leads to overdue items.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add context in notes">
    Always add notes when completing tasks. This creates an audit trail and helps colleagues understand the history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track response rates">
    Use the "Contact Responded" toggle consistently. This data helps identify which contacts engage most.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use outcomes systematically">
    Selecting the correct outcome helps generate accurate reports on business development success rates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Always record whether contacts responded for accurate engagement tracking. This data feeds into opportunity analytics.
</Warning>

## Viewing Task History

All completed tasks with their outcomes are logged and can be viewed:
- From the opportunity's follow-up section
- In the completed tasks tab
- Through management reports

<Tip>
Review follow-ups at the start and end of each day to stay on top of your business development activities.
