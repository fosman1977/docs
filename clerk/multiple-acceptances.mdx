What to do when multiple barristers accept the same lead.
</Note>

## When This Happens

If you assign a lead to multiple barristers and more than one accepts, you'll need to select which barrister gets the instruction.

## Notification

You'll receive:
- Dashboard alert
- Email notification
- Lead flagged as "Multiple Acceptances"

## Resolution Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review acceptances">
    Open the lead and see all barristers who accepted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare candidates">
    Consider workload, expertise, and suitability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select winner">
    Choose the barrister to take the work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify others">
    System automatically notifies unsuccessful barristers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Decision Factors

When choosing between candidates:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Expertise | Who is better suited? |
| Client preference | Any stated preference? |
| Workload balance | Who needs the work? |
| Response time | Who responded first? |
| Active matters | Who has fewer ongoing matters? |

## Auto-Resolution

Optionally configure automatic resolution:
- First-to-accept wins
- Based on engagement score
- Based on workload

<Info>
Automatic resolution can be configured in Settings → Lead Management.
