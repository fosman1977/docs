The Tasks feature provides a dedicated space for clerks to manage their daily work, track progress, and stay organised with a visual Kanban board or list view.

## Overview

The Tasks page (`/clerk/todos`) is a standalone task management system designed specifically for clerk workflows. Unlike Follow-up Tasks which are tied to opportunities and leads, Tasks are general-purpose items that can be used for any work you need to track.

## Accessing Tasks

Navigate to **Tasks** in the sidebar to access your task board.

## Views

### List View

The default view displays tasks in a table format with columns for:
- **Title** - Task name
- **Status** - Pending, In Progress, or Completed
- **Priority** - Low, Medium, High, or Urgent
- **Due Date** - When the task should be completed
- **Category** - Operations, Case Related, Admin, or Personal
- **Linked Lead** - Optional association with a lead

### Kanban View

Switch to Kanban view using the toggle in the filter bar. This displays tasks in three columns:

- **To Do** - Pending tasks not yet started
- **In Progress** - Tasks currently being worked on
- **Completed** - Finished tasks

Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status instantly.

## Creating Tasks

1. Click **New Task** button
2. Enter the task title (required)
3. Add optional details:
   - Description
   - Priority level
   - Category
   - Due date
   - Linked lead
4. Click **Create**

## Task Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | Short description of the task |
| Description | Detailed notes or instructions |
| Status | Current state (Pending, In Progress, Completed) |
| Priority | Urgency level (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) |
| Category | Type of work (Operations, Case Related, Admin, Personal) |
| Due Date | Target completion date |
| Linked Lead | Optional association with a lead |

## Filtering Tasks

Use the filter bar to narrow your view:

- **Status** - Show only tasks in a specific state
- **Priority** - Filter by urgency level
- **Category** - Show only specific task types
- **Due Date** - Filter by date range
- **Search** - Find tasks by title or description

## Completing Tasks

- **List view**: Click the checkbox next to the task
- **Kanban view**: Drag the task to the "Completed" column

Completed tasks remain visible in the Completed tab for reference.

## Linking Tasks to Leads

When creating or editing a task, you can link it to an existing lead. This is useful for:

- Tracking follow-up actions on leads
- Associating admin tasks with specific matters
- Creating a paper trail of work done on a lead

Linked leads appear as a badge on the task card for easy reference.

## Tasks vs Follow-up Tasks

| Feature | Tasks | Follow-up Tasks |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Purpose | General task management | Opportunity/lead specific follow-ups |
| Location | `/clerk/todos` | Opportunity detail pages |
| Linking | Optional lead linking | Always linked to opportunity |
| Outcomes | Simple complete/incomplete | Detailed outcome tracking |
| Automation | Manual creation | Auto-created by system |

Use Tasks for your personal and team to-do items. Use Follow-up Tasks when working specifically with opportunities that need outcome tracking.

## Mobile Support

The Tasks page is fully responsive:

- List view adapts to narrow screens
- Kanban columns stack vertically on mobile
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Swipe actions for quick status changes
