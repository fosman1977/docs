<Note>
The Tasks feature provides a dedicated space for clerks to manage their daily work, track progress, and stay organised with a visual Kanban board or list view.
</Note>

## Overview

The Tasks page (`/clerk/todos`) is a standalone task management system designed specifically for clerk workflows. Unlike [Follow-up Tasks](/clerk/follow-up-tasks) which are tied to opportunities and leads, Tasks are general-purpose items that can be used for any work you need to track.

## Accessing Tasks

Navigate to **Tasks** from the clerk sidebar, or press `N` anywhere in the application to quickly create a new task.

## Views

### List View

The default view displays tasks in a compact list with tabs for quick filtering:

<CardGroup cols={5}>
  <Card title="All" icon="list">
    All active tasks across the team
  </Card>
  <Card title="My Tasks" icon="user">
    Tasks assigned to you
  </Card>
  <Card title="Today" icon="calendar">
    Tasks due today
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overdue" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Past-due tasks requiring attention
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed" icon="circle-check">
    Finished tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Kanban View

Switch to Kanban view using the toggle in the filter bar. This displays tasks in three columns:

- **To Do** - Pending tasks not yet started
- **In Progress** - Tasks currently being worked on
- **Completed** - Finished tasks

Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status instantly.

Click **New Task** or press `N` to open the task creation modal.

## Categories

Organise your tasks by type:

- **Operations** - Day-to-day clerking activities
- **Case Related** - Tasks connected to specific matters
- **Administrative** - Internal admin work
- **Personal** - Personal reminders and tasks

## Managing Tasks

### Completing Tasks

- **List view**: Click the checkbox next to the task
- **Kanban view**: Drag the task to the "Completed" column

Completed tasks remain visible in the Completed tab for reference.

### Editing Tasks

Click the menu icon (three dots) on any task and select **Edit** to modify:
- Title and description
- Priority and category
- Due date
- Assignment
- Notes

### Deleting Tasks

Click the menu icon and select **Delete**. You'll be asked to confirm before the task is removed.

<Warning>
Deleted tasks cannot be recovered. Consider marking tasks as complete instead if you want to maintain a record.
</Warning>

## Filtering and Search

Use the filter bar to narrow down your task list:

- **Search** - Find tasks by title, description, or notes
- **Priority** - Filter by priority level
- **Category** - Filter by task category
- **Assignee** - Show only tasks assigned to a specific clerk

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `N` | Create new task |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Save task (when modal is open) |

## Linking Tasks to Leads

When creating or editing a task, you can link it to an existing lead. This is useful for:

- Tracking follow-up actions on leads
- Associating admin tasks with specific matters
- Creating a paper trail of work done on a lead

Linked leads appear as a badge on the task card for easy reference.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review tasks each morning">
    Start your day by checking the Today and Overdue tabs. Address overdue items first to prevent backlogs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use categories consistently">
    Consistent categorisation helps with filtering and reporting. Agree on category usage with your team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic due dates">
    Avoid setting everything as urgent. Thoughtful prioritisation makes the urgent items stand out.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add context in notes">
    Future you (or a colleague) will thank you for detailed notes explaining why a task exists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete tasks promptly">
    Mark tasks as complete immediately when finished to keep your list accurate.
  </Accordion>

## Tasks vs Follow-up Tasks

| Feature | Tasks | Follow-up Tasks |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Purpose | General task management | Opportunity/lead specific follow-ups |
| Location | `/clerk/todos` | Opportunity detail pages |
| Linking | Optional lead linking | Always linked to opportunity |
| Outcomes | Simple complete/incomplete | Detailed outcome tracking |
| Automation | Manual creation | Auto-created by system |

Use **Tasks** for your personal and team to-do items. Use **Follow-up Tasks** when working specifically with opportunities that need outcome tracking.
