## Understanding the Data

### Utilisation Percentage

| Percentage | Status |
|------------|--------|

| 60-80% | Optimal utilisation |
| 40-60% | Has capacity for more work |
| Below 40% | Quiet period, prioritise |

### Heatmap View

## Using Utilisation Data

When assigning leads:
- Check target barrister's current utilisation
