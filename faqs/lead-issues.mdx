Solutions for common issues with creating, assigning, and managing leads.

## Lead Creation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't create a new lead">
    **Possible causes:**
    - You don't have clerk or admin permissions
    - Required fields are missing (title, practice area, client)
    - Browser session has expired

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check your role in the header - you need "Clerk" or higher
    2. Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are completed
    3. Refresh the page and try again
    4. If the issue persists, log out and log back in
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client dropdown is empty">
    **Cause:** No clients exist in the system yet.

    **Solution:**
    1. Click "Create New Client" in the client dropdown
    2. Or navigate to **CRM → Clients → New Client** first
    3. Then return to lead creation and select the new client
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Practice area is missing from the list">
    **Cause:** Practice areas are configured by administrators.

    **Solution:**
    1. Contact your administrator to add the practice area
    2. Or select the closest matching practice area and note the actual area in the description
    3. Administrators can add practice areas at **Settings → Practice Areas**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lead created but not showing in list">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Active filters are hiding the lead
    - Page needs refreshing
    - Lead was archived immediately

    **Solutions:**
    1. Click "Clear Filters" above the lead list
    2. Check the "All" tab instead of "My Leads"
    3. Use the search box to find the lead by title
    4. Refresh the page with Cmd/Ctrl + R
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Lead Assignment Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI suggestions not appearing">
    **Possible causes:**
    - AI service is temporarily unavailable
    - Lead lacks sufficient detail for matching
    - OpenAI API key is not configured

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait 30 seconds and refresh the page
    2. Add more detail to the lead description and practice area
    3. Proceed with manual barrister selection
    4. If the issue persists, contact your administrator

    **Fallback:** You can always manually select barristers using the assignment dialog.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Barrister I need isn't in the suggestion list">
    **Cause:** The AI may not have matched them based on practice areas or experience.

    **Solution:**
    1. Click "Show All Barristers" in the assignment dialog
    2. Use the search box to find the specific barrister
    3. Select them manually - AI suggestions are recommendations, not requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find suitable barristers to assign">
    **Possible causes:**
    - No barristers have the matching practice area
    - Barristers have many active matters

    **Solutions:**
    1. Click "Show All Barristers" in the assignment dialog
    2. Use the search box to find barristers by name
    3. Contact the barrister directly to confirm capacity
    4. Consider barristers with secondary practice area matches
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lead stuck in 'Assigned' status">
    **Cause:** The barrister(s) haven't responded yet.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check how long since assignment - barristers have 48 hours to respond
    2. View the lead detail to see who was assigned
    3. Send a reminder via the platform messaging or email directly
    4. Consider reassigning if the lead is urgent
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Barrister Response Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I accepted a lead but it still shows as pending (Barrister)">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Multiple barristers were assigned and accepted (conflict)
    - Network error during acceptance
    - Page showing cached data

    **Solutions:**
    1. Refresh the page to see the current status
    2. If you see "Multi-Acceptance Conflict", the clerk will resolve it
    3. Check for a notification confirming your acceptance
    4. If unsure, contact your clerk
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't accept or reject a lead">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Lead has already been accepted by another barrister
    - Lead has been withdrawn by the clerk
    - Your session has expired

    **Solutions:**
    1. Refresh the page to see current status
    2. If the lead shows "Instructed" or "Closed", another barrister was selected
    3. Log out and log back in if buttons are unresponsive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-acceptance conflict">
    **What happened:** Two or more barristers accepted the same lead.

    **What to do:**
    - **Barristers:** No action needed - the clerk will select who proceeds
    - **Clerks:** Go to the lead detail → click "Resolve Conflict" → select the barrister who will proceed → the others will be notified

    The resolution notification shows: "Another barrister has been selected for this lead."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Lead Status Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I close a lead?">
    **To mark a lead as won (instructed):**
    1. Open the lead detail
    2. Click "Update Status"
    3. Select "Instructed"
    4. Add any notes about the instruction

    **To mark a lead as lost:**
    1. Open the lead detail
    2. Click "Update Status"
    3. Select "Lost" or "No Response"
    4. Optionally add a reason

    **To archive:**
    1. Open the lead detail
    2. Click the ⋮ menu
    3. Select "Archive"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reopen an archived lead?">
    **Yes:**
    1. Go to **Leads → All Leads**
    2. Filter by "Archived"
    3. Find the lead and open it
    4. Click "Restore Lead"

    The lead will return to its previous status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lead history is missing">
    **Cause:** You may not have permission to view full history.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check you're viewing as Clerk or Management
    2. Barristers can only see their own lead assignments
    3. Full history is in the "Activity" tab of the lead detail
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate leads in the system">
    **Prevention:** The system checks for duplicates on import and manual creation.

    **If duplicates exist:**
    1. Open the duplicate lead
    2. Click ⋮ menu → "Mark as Duplicate"
    3. Select the original lead to link to
    4. The duplicate will be archived but linked for reference

    **Bulk cleanup:** Contact your administrator for bulk deduplication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lead data was lost after editing">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Browser closed before save completed
    - Network error during save
    - Another user edited simultaneously

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check the Activity tab - edits are logged there
    2. Restore from activity log if available
    3. Re-enter the lost data

    **Prevention:** The platform auto-saves drafts. Ensure you see "Saved" confirmation before closing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
