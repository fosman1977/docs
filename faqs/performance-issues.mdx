Solutions for when the platform is slow, unresponsive, or experiencing errors.

## Page Loading Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pages are loading slowly">
    **Common causes:**
    - Slow internet connection
    - Browser cache is full
    - Too many browser tabs open
    - Large dataset being loaded

    **Quick fixes:**
    1. **Refresh the page** - Cmd/Ctrl + R
    2. **Hard refresh** - Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R (clears page cache)
    3. **Close unused tabs** - Free up browser memory
    4. **Check your connection** - Try loading another website

    **If still slow:**
    1. Clear browser cache: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached images and files
    2. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    3. Disable browser extensions temporarily
    4. Check if the issue occurs on mobile data vs WiFi
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dashboard takes too long to load">
    **Why it happens:** The dashboard loads data from multiple sources (leads, opportunities, financial data, calendar).

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Wait a few seconds** - First load may take 3-5 seconds
    2. **Check widget by widget** - One integration may be slow
    3. **Reduce date range** - If filtering by date, use a smaller range

    **If consistently slow:**
    - Check the connection status indicator in the footer
    - Report to your administrator - there may be a sync issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infinite loading spinner">
    **Causes:**
    - Network request failed silently
    - JavaScript error on the page
    - Session expired mid-load

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Refresh the page** - Most common fix
    2. **Check browser console** - Press F12 → Console tab → Look for red errors
    3. **Log out and log back in** - Session may have expired
    4. **Try incognito/private mode** - Rules out extension conflicts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Failed to load' error messages">
    **What they mean:**

    | Error | Cause | Fix |
    |-------|-------|-----|
    | "Failed to load leads" | API error or timeout | Refresh page |
    | "Network error" | No internet connection | Check WiFi/ethernet |
    | "Session expired" | Login timeout | Log in again |
    | "Server error (500)" | Backend issue | Wait and retry, report if persists |

    **General approach:**
    1. Wait 30 seconds and refresh
    2. Check your internet connection
    3. Try a different browser
    4. Report to support if the error persists for 10+ minutes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-Time Updates Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Updates not appearing in real-time">
    **Check the connection status** in the page footer:
    - **🟢 Connected** - Real-time should work
    - **🟡 Reconnecting** - Updates will resume shortly
    - **🔴 Offline** - Manual refresh needed

    **If showing "Connected" but no updates:**
    1. Refresh the page to re-establish the socket connection
    2. Check if updates work in a different browser tab
    3. Your firewall or VPN may be blocking WebSocket connections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Notifications not appearing">
    **Browser notifications:**
    1. Check browser notification permissions for the platform
    2. Ensure browser notifications are enabled in your OS settings
    3. Check "Do Not Disturb" isn't enabled

    **In-app notifications:**
    1. Check the notification bell icon in the header
    2. Your notification preferences may be limiting what you see
    3. Go to **Settings → Notifications** to review preferences
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data seems stale or outdated">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Viewing cached data from a previous session
    - Sync jobs haven't run yet (financial data syncs daily at 2am)
    - Filter is hiding new items

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Hard refresh** - Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R
    2. **Clear filters** - Click "Clear Filters" if available
    3. **Check last sync time** - Visible in Settings → Integrations
    4. **Wait for sync** - Financial data from Xero updates overnight
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Form and Interaction Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Form won't submit / buttons not responding">
    **Causes:**
    - Validation error not visible (scroll up to see it)
    - Double-click caused duplicate submission
    - JavaScript error blocking the action

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Scroll to top of form** - Look for red error messages
    2. **Check required fields** - Fields with * must be completed
    3. **Wait for loading** - Button may show a spinner
    4. **Refresh and try again** - If button is stuck
    5. **Check browser console** - F12 → Console for errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dropdown menus not working">
    **Causes:**
    - Page not fully loaded
    - JavaScript conflict with browser extension
    - Mobile browser compatibility

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait for the page to fully load (check loading indicators)
    2. Disable browser extensions and retry
    3. Try a different browser
    4. On mobile, tap directly on the dropdown (not the label)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search isn't finding results">
    **Tips for better search:**
    - Use partial matches: "smith" finds "John Smith KC"
    - Search by lead ID if you have it
    - Check you're searching the right entity type (leads vs clients)
    - Clear existing filters that may conflict

    **If search returns nothing when it should:**
    1. Clear all filters
    2. Check you're in the right section
    3. Refresh the page and try again
    4. Verify the item exists by browsing manually
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Browser-Specific Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Issues in Safari">
    **Common Safari issues:**
    - Cookies blocked by Intelligent Tracking Prevention
    - Third-party cookies required for auth

    **Solutions:**
    1. Go to Safari → Preferences → Privacy
    2. Uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking" temporarily
    3. Or use Chrome/Firefox for the platform
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issues in Internet Explorer">
    **Internet Explorer is not supported.**

    Please use one of these browsers:
    - Google Chrome (recommended)
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Safari (macOS)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mobile browser issues">
    **For best mobile experience:**
    - Use the latest Chrome or Safari
    - Rotate to landscape for data tables
    - Use the mobile-specific menu (hamburger icon)

    **Known limitations:**
    - Some complex forms work better on desktop
    - File uploads may be limited by device
    - Real-time updates may be delayed to save battery
  </Accordion>
