This guide walks you through your first login to the Chambers Platform.
</Note>

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have received your login credentials from your chambers administrator. You will need:

- Your chambers email address
- Your temporary password (sent via email)
- Access to your email inbox to verify your account

## Step-by-Step Login Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Platform">
    Open your web browser and go to [chambers-platform.vercel.app](https://chambers-platform.vercel.app) (or your chambers' custom domain). You'll see the login page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Credentials">
    1. Enter your chambers email address in the Email field
    2. Enter your temporary password in the Password field
    3. Click the "Sign In" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Role (if applicable)">
    If you have multiple roles assigned (e.g., both Barrister and Management), you'll be prompted to select which role you want to use for this session. You can switch roles later from the user menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change Your Password">
    For security, you'll be prompted to change your temporary password. Choose a strong password that:
    - Is at least 8 characters long
    - Contains uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Contains at least one number
    - Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Your Profile">
    After logging in, navigate to your profile settings to complete your information. This is especially important for barristers who need to set their specialisations and jurisdictions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I didn't receive my login credentials">
    Contact your chambers administrator to request your credentials. They can generate a new invitation from the User Management section.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My password isn't working">
    Ensure you're entering the password exactly as provided (passwords are case-sensitive). If you've forgotten your password, use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting an 'Invalid credentials' error">
    Double-check your email address and password. If the problem persists, your account may not be activated yet - contact your administrator.
