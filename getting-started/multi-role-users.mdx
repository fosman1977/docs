Understanding how to work with multiple roles in the Chambers Platform.
</Note>

## What Are Multi-Role Users?

Some users may be assigned multiple roles in the platform. For example, a senior clerk might have both "Clerk" and "Management" roles to access different areas of the system.

## Selecting Your Role at Login

When you log in with multiple roles, you'll see a role selection screen. Choose the role you want to use for your current session. Each role provides access to different features and dashboards.

## Switching Roles

You can switch roles without logging out:

1. Click your name/avatar in the top-right corner
2. Look for "Switch Role" in the dropdown menu
3. Select the role you want to switch to
4. The page will refresh with your new role's permissions

## Role Permissions

Each role has specific permissions:
