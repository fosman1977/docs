## Main Navigation Areas

The platform is organised into several key areas accessible from the sidebar navigation:

### Sidebar Menu

The left sidebar contains your main navigation. Items shown depend on your role:

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dashboard | Your main overview page with key metrics |
| Leads | Lead management (Clerks and Barristers) |
| Opportunities | Business development opportunities |
| CRM | Client relationship management (Clerks) |
| Barristers | Barrister profiles and management (Clerks) |
| Calendar | Scheduling and availability |
| Reports | Report generation and analytics |
| Admin | System administration (Management only) |

### Top Header Bar

The header bar provides quick access to:

- **Search** - Global search across all platform data
- **Notifications** - Real-time alerts and updates
- **Messages** - Internal messaging system
- **Help** - Contextual help (also accessible via Shift + ?)
- **User Menu** - Profile, settings, role switching, and logout

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Use these shortcuts to navigate faster:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift + ?` | Open contextual help for current page |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | Open global search |
| `Escape` | Close modals and dialogs |

## Breadcrumbs

When navigating into sub-pages, breadcrumbs appear at the top showing your location. Click any breadcrumb to navigate back to that level.

## Data Tables

Most list views use data tables with these features:

- **Column sorting** - Click column headers to sort
- **Filtering** - Use the filter controls above tables
- **Pagination** - Navigate pages at the bottom
- **Row actions** - Click rows or use action buttons

<Tip>
The sidebar can be collapsed on smaller screens. Look for the menu icon to toggle it.
