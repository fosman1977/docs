This guide explains how the Chambers Platform works and what you'll experience when you first log in. For role-specific features, see the [Barrister](/barrister/quick-start), [Clerk](/clerk/quick-start), or [Management](/management/quick-start) guides.

## How the Platform Works

The Chambers Platform connects three key workflows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Enquiry] --> B[Lead Created]
    B --> C[AI Suggests Barristers]
    C --> D[Clerk Assigns Lead]
    D --> E[Barrister Accepts/Rejects]
    E --> F[Work Instructed]
    F --> G[Xero Tracks Billing]
    G --> H[Management Reports]
```

**Clerks** create and assign leads. **Barristers** respond and complete work. **Management** monitors performance. All data flows automatically through the system.

## Your First Login

### What You'll See

When you first log in, you'll land on your role-specific dashboard:

| Role | Dashboard Shows |
|------|-----------------|
| **Barrister** | Pending leads to respond to, your performance metrics, upcoming opportunities |
| **Clerk** | Unassigned leads, leads awaiting response, barrister availability overview |
| **Management** | Executive KPIs, financial summary, AI-generated insights |

## Understanding the Interface

### Navigation Structure

- **Header** - Your profile, role switcher (if multi-role), notifications bell, and global search
- **Sidebar** - Main navigation organised by feature area (Leads, Opportunities, Reports, etc.)
- **Main Content** - The active page with data tables, forms, or dashboards
- **Quick Actions** - Floating action buttons for common tasks like "New Lead"

### Key Interface Patterns

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Red badge with number | Items requiring your attention |
| Green status pill | Active/healthy status |
| Orange/amber pill | Warning or pending state |
| Sparkline charts | Trend over time (hover for values) |
| Three-dot menu (⋮) | Additional actions for that item |

## Multi-Role Users

Some users have multiple roles (e.g., a barrister who also serves as a door tenant manager).

**To switch roles:**
1. Click your name in the header
2. Select **Switch Role**
3. Choose your desired role from the dropdown
4. Your dashboard and navigation will update accordingly

<Tip>
Your current role appears below your name in the header. Each role has its own dashboard and permissions.
