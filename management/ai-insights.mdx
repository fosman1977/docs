AI-powered insights to help you make informed decisions, now with time-of-year trajectory analysis.

## What Are AI Insights?

AI Insights analyse your chambers data to identify:
- Trends and patterns
- Potential risks
- Business opportunities
- Anomalies requiring attention
- **Trajectory status** - are you on track given where you are in the year?

## Trajectory Analysis (New)

The AI now considers **when in the year** you're viewing the data, not just year-end targets.

### How It Works

At any point in the year, the AI calculates where barristers **should** be based on a pro-rata share of their annual target:

| Month | Expected Progress |
|-------|------------------|
| March (Q1) | ~25% |
| June (Q2) | ~50% |
| September (Q3) | ~75% |
| December (Q4) | 100% |

### Trajectory Statuses

Each barrister is classified based on their current progress vs expected:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **AHEAD** | >5% above expected pace | Strong performer |
| **ON TRACK** | Within ±5% of expected | No action needed |
| **BEHIND PACE** | 5-15% below expected | Monitor closely |
| **SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND** | >15% below expected | Intervention needed |

<Warning>
A barrister showing GREEN status (e.g., 60% of target) in September is actually BEHIND PACE because they should be at ~75% by then. The AI flags this distinction.
</Warning>

### Example Analysis

In **September** (month 9 of 12):
- Expected pro-rata: 75%
- Barrister A at 80%: **AHEAD** of pace
- Barrister B at 73%: **ON TRACK**
- Barrister C at 60%: **BEHIND PACE** (needs monitoring)
- Barrister D at 45%: **SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND** (urgent intervention)

## Types of Insights

### Performance Insights
- Barrister performance trends with **trajectory status**
- Conversion rate analysis
- Revenue forecasting
- Year-over-year comparisons

### Risk Alerts
- Cash flow concerns (including bank balances and receivables)
- Utilisation imbalances
- Client concentration risks
- **Barristers behind pace** requiring intervention

### Opportunity Identification
- Growth areas
- Underserved practice areas
- Client development opportunities
- Lead source performance

## Data Included in Analysis

The AI analyses comprehensive data from across the platform:

- **Financial**: Billing, contributions, targets, aged debt
- **Cash Flow**: Bank balances, outstanding invoices, runway
- **Historical**: Year-over-year comparisons and trends
- **Leads**: Conversion funnel, source performance
- **Clients**: Relationship health, concentration risk
- **Utilisation**: Work type distribution, capacity
- **Website**: Practice area traffic, visitor companies

## Viewing Insights

Access from:
- Executive Dashboard widget
- Dedicated AI Insights page
- Email summaries (if configured)

## Asking Questions

Use the **AI Chat** feature to ask natural language questions about your data:

- "Which barristers are behind their targets?"
- "What's our cash position?"
- "Which practice areas are growing?"
- "Who needs more work?"

The AI considers trajectory when answering, so asking "who's behind?" will identify barristers behind **pace**, not just behind year-end targets.

## Acting on Insights

Each insight includes:
- Summary of finding
- Supporting data with trajectory context
- Recommended actions
- Links to relevant areas
