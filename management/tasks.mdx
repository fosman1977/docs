The Tasks feature provides management with a dedicated workspace to track strategic initiatives, operational items, and oversight responsibilities. Fully responsive for mobile and tablet use.

## Overview

The Tasks page provides a centralised task management system for management-level work. Use it to track strategic initiatives, cross-team projects, and high-level operational items that don't fit within the clerk-focused workflow.

Management has read-only access to clerk tasks for oversight purposes, while maintaining a separate task board for management-specific work.

## Accessing Tasks

Navigate to **Tasks** in the sidebar.

## Management Task Board

### Creating Tasks

1. Click **New Task**
2. Enter task details:
   - Title (required)
   - Description
   - Priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - Category
   - Due date
3. Click **Create**

### List View

View tasks in a table format with sortable columns:
- Title
- Status
- Priority
- Due Date
- Category

### Kanban View

Toggle to Kanban view for a visual workflow with three columns:

- **To Do** - Items not yet started
- **In Progress** - Active work items
- **Completed** - Finished tasks

Drag and drop tasks between columns to update status instantly. On mobile, the columns stack vertically for easy scrolling.

## Viewing Clerk Tasks

Management can view clerk task boards for workload oversight.

When viewing clerk tasks, management sees a read-only view with a clear indicator:

- Tasks display with "Viewing tasks (read-only)" message
- Create, edit, and delete actions are hidden
- Drag-and-drop is disabled in Kanban view
- Full filtering and search remains available

This allows management to monitor workload and progress without interfering with clerk workflows.

### Accessing Clerk Tasks

1. Navigate to **Tasks**
2. Use the **View** dropdown
3. Select a specific clerk to view their tasks
