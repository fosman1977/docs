<Note>
The Tasks feature provides management with a dedicated workspace to track strategic initiatives, operational items, and oversight responsibilities. Fully responsive for mobile and tablet use.
</Note>

## Overview

The Tasks page provides a centralised task management system for management-level work. Use it to track strategic initiatives, cross-team projects, and high-level operational items that don't fit within the clerk-focused workflow.

Management has **read-only access** to clerk tasks for oversight purposes, while maintaining a separate task board for management-specific work.

## Accessing Tasks

Navigate to **Tasks** from the management sidebar. The interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Views

### List View

The default view displays tasks in a compact list with quick-filter tabs:

<CardGroup cols={5}>

</CardGroup>

### Kanban View

Toggle to Kanban view for a visual workflow with three columns:

Drag and drop tasks between columns to update status instantly. On mobile, the columns stack vertically for easy scrolling.

## Categories for Management

Organise tasks by type:

- **Operations** - Chambers operational matters
- **Case Related** - High-value or sensitive matter oversight
- **Administrative** - Governance, compliance, and admin work
- **Personal** - Personal reminders and scheduling

## Team Oversight

Management has full visibility across all tasks in the system:

### Viewing Clerk Tasks

When viewing clerk tasks, management sees a **read-only view** with a clear indicator:

- Tasks display with "Viewing tasks (read-only)" message
- Create, edit, and delete actions are hidden
- Drag-and-drop is disabled in Kanban view
- Full filtering and search remains available

This allows management to monitor workload and progress without interfering with clerk workflows.

### Monitoring Team Workload

- Use the **All** tab to see tasks across the entire team
- Filter by **Assignee** to view a specific team member's workload
- Monitor the **Overdue** tab to identify bottlenecks

### Delegation

Assign tasks to clerks or other management members:

1. Create a new task or edit an existing one
2. Select the assignee from the **Assign To** dropdown
3. Set an appropriate due date and priority
4. Add notes with any specific instructions

The assigned team member will see the task in their **My Tasks** tab.

## Filtering and Search

Use the filter bar to focus your view:

- **Search** - Find tasks by title, description, or notes
- **Priority** - Filter by urgency level
- **Category** - Filter by task type
- **Assignee** - View tasks for specific team members

## Mobile Access

The Tasks feature is fully optimised for mobile devices:

- **Responsive layout** - Automatically adapts to screen size
- **Touch-friendly** - Large tap targets for easy interaction
- **Mobile navigation** - Access via the mobile menu
- **Kanban on mobile** - Columns stack vertically for scrolling

<Tip>
Use the mobile app when away from your desk to quickly check on task progress or create urgent items on the go.
</Tip>

## Managing Tasks

### Completing Tasks

### Editing Tasks

Click the menu icon (three dots) and select **Edit** to modify any task field.

### Deleting Tasks

Click the menu icon and select **Delete**. Confirmation is required.

<Warning>
Deleted tasks cannot be recovered. Consider completing rather than deleting to maintain an audit trail.
</Warning>

## Best Practices for Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use tasks for strategic items">
    Reserve the Tasks feature for items that need tracking. Quick one-off actions may not need formal task creation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set clear ownership">
    Always assign tasks to specific individuals. Unassigned tasks often fall through the cracks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review overdue items weekly">
    Regular review of overdue tasks helps identify systemic issues or unrealistic deadlines.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Link to leads when relevant">
    Connecting tasks to leads creates an audit trail and provides context for future reference.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use priority thoughtfully">
    If everything is urgent, nothing is urgent. Reserve high/urgent for genuinely time-sensitive items.
  </Accordion>
