<Note>
Link barristers to their Xero contacts for accurate financial tracking and billing attribution.
</Note>

## Overview

Xero mappings connect platform barrister profiles to their corresponding Xero contacts. This enables:

- **Work Done Tracking** - Aggregate invoiced work by barrister
- **Contribution Calculations** - Automatic tier assignment (14%, 7%, 3%, 1%)
- **Billing Dashboard** - Individual barrister financial views
- **Cash Flow Analysis** - Accurate revenue attribution

## Accessing Xero Mappings

Navigate to **Admin** → **Financial** → **Xero Mappings**

<Info>
This is currently a dedicated admin page. Future releases will integrate mapping directly into barrister profile pages.
</Info>

## Mapping Status

Each barrister shows one of three states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mapped | Linked to a Xero contact |
| Unmapped | No Xero contact linked |
| Multiple Matches | Several potential Xero contacts found |

## Auto-Mapping

The system attempts automatic matching by:

1. **Email Address** - Exact match on primary email
2. **Full Name** - Fuzzy matching on name fields
3. **Known Aliases** - Alternative name configurations

<Tip>
Run auto-mapping after adding new barristers to quickly link obvious matches.
</Tip>

4. Manually resolve remaining unmapped records

## What Gets Synced

<Info>

### Invoices

### Payments
- Payment receipts
- Payment dates
- Outstanding amounts

### Work Done Metrics

## Contribution Tiers

Mapped barristers automatically receive contribution tier assignments:

| Tier | Contribution Rate | Criteria |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | 14% | Highest revenue contributors |
| Tier 2 | 7% | Strong contributors |
| Tier 3 | 3% | Standard contributors |
| Tier 4 | 1% | Developing contributors |

<Warning>
Unmapped barristers won't appear in financial reports or have contribution tiers calculated.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Barrister not found in Xero**
- Check spelling variations (e.g., "Chris" vs "Christopher")
- Verify the Xero contact exists
- Check if archived in Xero

**Wrong contact linked**
- Edit the mapping and search again
- Use email address for more accurate matching

**Financial data not showing**
- Verify mapping is saved
- Wait for next Xero sync (hourly)
- Check Xero contact has invoices

### Sync Status

View last sync time at the top of the page. Manual sync can be triggered from **Admin** → **Integrations** → **Xero** → **Sync Now**
