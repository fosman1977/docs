## What Are Mappings?

Mappings link platform entities to Xero contacts:
- Barristers → Xero contacts
- Clients → Xero contacts

## Why Mappings Matter

Correct mappings ensure:
- Accurate billing data
- Proper revenue attribution
- Correct financial reporting

## Viewing Mappings

Access from **Admin** → **Integrations** → **Xero Mappings**

## Managing Mappings

### Auto-Mapping
System attempts to match by:
- Email address
- Name matching
- Company name

### Manual Mapping
For unmatched records:
1. Select platform record
2. Search Xero contacts
3. Link manually

### Unmapped Records
Review and resolve:
- Records without Xero links
- Multiple potential matches
- Conflicts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- Name variations between systems
- Missing email addresses
- Duplicate Xero contacts
