## Q1-Q2 2026: Aged Debt Intelligence

### Clerk Decision Support System

**What's Coming**

A comprehensive system to help clerks manage aged debt more systematically and preserve institutional knowledge.

**Why It Matters**

- **For Clerks:** Clear guidance on which aged debts to pursue, standardised processes across all clerks
- **For Management:** Visibility into debt recovery strategies, better cash flow forecasting
- **For New Clerks:** Faster training through AI-powered recommendations based on historical patterns

**Key Features**

**Phase 1: Foundation & Policy Definition** *(January-February 2026)*
- Define chambers-wide aged debt policies (write-off thresholds, collection processes)
- Establish approval workflows and delegation of authority
- Document best practices from senior clerks

**Phase 2: Decision Support Tools** *(March-April 2026)*
- Daily prioritised action list: "These 10 debts need attention today"
- Quick classification: flag debts as "Chase hard", "Monitor", "Probably lost", or "Write off"
- Template actions: standard reminder emails, escalation procedures
- Activity tracking: record all actions taken and when

**Phase 3: Knowledge Capture** *(May-June 2026)*
- Capture clerk reasoning: "Why is this debt marked as unrecoverable?"
- Client relationship protection: flag debts linked to important clients
- Pattern recognition: "You usually handle similar debts this way..."
- Historical context for new clerks

**Phase 4: Management Visibility** *(May-June 2026)*
- Dashboard showing realistic vs. probably lost debt
- Clerk workload distribution and capacity planning
- Collection rate tracking and benchmarking
- Automated reporting for management review

**Timeline:** January-June 2026 (6 months)

**Status:** Policy Definition Required

<Warning>
  **Action Required:** Aged debt implementation requires chambers leadership to define policies for write-off thresholds, collection processes, and approval workflows. Workshop sessions with senior clerks and management needed in January 2026.
